# 1. Find out what a “flow chart” is and write a few.
# 2. If you find errors in code you are reading, try to fix them and send the author your
# changes.
# 3. Another technique for when you are not using paper is to put # comments with your
# notes in the code. Sometimes, these could become the actual comments to help the next
# person.
